# Selenium_Python_Web_Automation


This is a sample Web Automation Project with Selenium using Python Language.

The Tests include Form Submissions and End to End test for Sample Shopping Site.

All the tests are divided into multiple folders for modularity and pytest framework has been used to do this and also run all the tests at once.

Html Report can be generated by importing the package using command :  pip install pytest-html and while running all tests using comand py.test --html=report.html

Logging module is also imported and used in the project which generates the logs and the same can be shown in the reports generated.

A jenkins war file can be downloaded and run with command: java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=9090

Then on logging into localhost:9090 in the browser and creating a new login account, the same tests can be run using jenkins.
